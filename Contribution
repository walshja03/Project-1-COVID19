My Contribution to our Group Project

I would say my greatest contributions came in the cleaning up and organization of the data.  Realizing issues with data quality and rectifying them/understanding why they were occuring, looking into API pulls and adjusting our reads to include more data which was useful, rectifying issues which arose from the presents of null values or placeholders such as **** in the dataframe. In addition to that I spent a lot of time troubleshooting issues that people were having. I probably spent 10-15 hours working with individuals or in a group setting both inside and outside of class helping people problem solve code issues. This included group issues with the GitHub which I leaned heavily on the TA's and yourself to aid with. This was extremely valuable in learning and I am glad to have gone through this experience with project 1 though it made my time spent on the project be upwards of 30 hours.

I would say I contributed a good amount to the leadership and setting standards as well.  I tried to encourage and support my team members in creating graphs that were readable and accurate as well as understanding what their graphics said.  For Ex: The pie charts were intially unreadable due to the number of slices so I shared code to generate and create an other category to encompass the mulititude of countries with insignificant findings.

We broke out the notebooks with labels for contributions so you can see some breakdown of code.
